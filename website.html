 <ul>
    <li><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/html-doctypes/" target="_blank"><b>&lt;1DOCTYPE&gt;</b></a> :- This is the document type declaration, not a tag. It declares that the document is an HTML5 document.</li>
    <li><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/html-html-tag/" target="_blank"><b>&lt;HTML&gt;</b></a> :- This is called the HTML root element. All other elements are contained within it.</li>
    <li><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/html-head-tag/" target="_blank"><b>&lthead&gt;</b></a> :- The head tag contains the “behind the scenes” elements for a webpage.</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/html-title-tag/" target="_blank"><b>&lt;title&gt;</b></a> :- The title is what is displayed on the top of your browser when you visit a website and contains the title of the webpage that you are viewing.</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/html-h1-to-h6-tag/" target="_blank"><b>&lt;h2&gt;</b></a> :- The < h2 > tag is a second-level heading tag</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/html-p-tag/" target="_blank"><b>&lt;p&gt;</b></a> :- The < p > tag represents a paragraph of text.</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/html-body-tag/" target="_blank"><b>&lt;body&gt;</b></a> :- The body tag is used to enclose all the visible content of a webpage. In other words, the body content is what the browser will show on the front end.</li>
</ul>
<p>An HTML document can be created using an HTML text editor. Save the text file using the “.html” or “.htm” extension. Once saved as an HTML document, the file can be opened as a webpage in the browser.</p>
<p> <b>Note : </b>Basic/built-in text editors are Notepad (Windows) and TextEdit (MacOS). Other advanced text editors include Sublime Text, Visual Studio Code, Froala, etc.
    <h2 id="browser">Web Browsers</h2>
    <p>Unlike other programming languages, HTML does not show output on the compiler. Web browsers show the results of an HTML code.</p>
    <p>It reads HTML files and determines how to show content with the help of HTML tags. Any web browser (Google, Safari, Mozilla Firefox, etc) can be used to open a . HTML file and view the results.</p>
